The Issue: Your Vercel frontend was secure (HTTPS), but it was trying to talk to a raw IP address (HTTP) on your EC2. Browsers strictly block this "Mixed Content" because it’s a massive security vulnerability.

The Solution: We used sslip.io to create a free domain name for your IP (13.53.168.20.sslip.io) and then used Certbot to generate a real SSL certificate. This made your backend secure, satisfying the browser's security requirements.
